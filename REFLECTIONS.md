What patterns or surprises did you notice?
I was surprised at how easy it was to write the math functions. It was super simple as essentially all functions where the name of what it did. For example, even checks if a number is even and od,d if the number is odd etc.
It was really cool as it allows for easy writing and debugging. 

What logic challenged your thinking?
The logic that challenged my thinking was how easy it was really to write this sort of code. I thought it would be somewhat hard but with this toolkit, it made it surprisingly easy as I thought I was going to have to
debug most of my code. 

How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?
This toolkit can be used in the real world for writing JavaScript code that is needed to calculate things for applications like distance from what place to another. As well as amount of charging platforms to charge, maybe a 
certain tax rate or debit/credit card fee. Anywhere where there needs to be a calculation that needs Algebra.
