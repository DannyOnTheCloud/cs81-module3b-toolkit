First Prediction: I predict that the following function,  `double(num)` will return the number multiplied by 2. 

Second Prection: I predict that the following function, `square(num)` will return the multiplication of a number by itself.


Third Prediction: I predict that the following function, `isEven(num)` will return true if the number is divisible by 2 thus finding out if it is an even integer.

Fourth Prediction: I predict that the following function,  `isOdd(num)` will return true if the number is not divisible by 2 thus finding out if it is an odd number.

Fifth Prediction: I predict that the following function, `multiply(a, b)` will return the result of a * b giving us the result of two numbers being multiplied .
